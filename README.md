# SEA(Self Evaluation of Advising effetiveness)

The Self-evaluation checklists are designed to assist Ph.D. advisors to improve their advising skills. This code solves the complex equations of human interactions. After the problem is simulated, it determines how good you are at advising your students. 

## Running SEA

It is python-based program written specifically for one type simulation. Although, the same capability could be extended for multiple problems in future with enough support (time) for this project.

The source code can be used simply by typing on the terminal screen:

```
python sea.py
```

In the current version, it is assumed that the user has Python 3 installed on their system (if user is still using Python 2.x.x, they must be old-school and refrain from using this program). The program must be in the current directory from where it is called.
